# Invisible Point Calculation
Notebook and materials for projective reconstruction of the 8th vertex (invisible point) of a cuboid from a single photograph.

# Summary
Used the centroid-based method for finding the three vanishing points. Afterwards, calculated the intersection of lines passing through two of the vanishing points and respective points, effectively estimating the position of the missing vertex.
